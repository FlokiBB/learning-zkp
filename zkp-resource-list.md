# Zero-knowledge proof learning resource summary 

Zero-knowledge proof technology is one of the three foundations of modern cryptography, proposed by S.Goldwasser, S.Micali and C.Rackoff in the early 1980s. Early zero-knowledge proofs were not well utilized due to their limitations in efficiency and usability, and remained at the theoretical level. It was not until recent years that the theoretical research on zero-knowledge proofs began to make continuous breakthroughs. At the same time, blockchain also created opportunities for zero-knowledge proofs to show their strengths, and thus entered the public eye. 

As the popularity of zero-knowledge proof, a "black technology", gradually increases, relevant learning resources are gradually enriched. However, on the one hand, the principles behind zero-knowledge proofs are quite complex and have a lot of content; on the other hand, the quality of learning resources for zero-knowledge proofs is uneven and has not yet formed a system. Therefore, for the vast majority of readers, it is still very difficult to learn zero-knowledge proofs. 

This article collects some learning materials about zero-knowledge proof (including popular science articles, papers, open source warehouses and related learning websites, etc.), and organizes and analyzes these resources, hoping to be helpful to everyone. 

*Due to the limited time for collation and the limitations of the author's own knowledge, there are deficiencies in the article, and corrections, supplements and discussions are welcome. * 


## 1. Zero-knowledge proof in the story Friends who are 

new to zero-knowledge proof will definitely ask, what is zero-knowledge proof? What exactly is it doing? 

Recommend a few articles suitable for Xiaobai:

The application of zero-knowledge proof is gradually increasing, from the earliest public chain zCash, Monero, to the recent zkPoD based on the Ethereum platform, Loopring DEX 3.0 application, etc., zero-knowledge proof will be more and more applied in the blockchain field. 

## 7. Technology and vulnerability analysis related to zero-knowledge proof The article 

zero-knowledge proof technology involves a lot of knowledge content. In actual application scenarios, there are still many challenges in the realization of zero-knowledge proof, such as protocol security, performance and other issues. It is possible to limit its development. This section recommends some technical analysis and vulnerability analysis articles.

* BulletProof 

   1. [Gro09 ](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-03356-8_12) proposed a method to prove "vector inner product":
